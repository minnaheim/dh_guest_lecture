## Intro {visibility="hidden"}
<!-- Hello everybody, today I will be talking to you about data, as you have learnt about it until today, and I will try to help you put some of this knowledge into context, and show you how some of this data might be used in economic research -->
```{r}
library(yaml)
library(tidyverse)
```

<!-- so you might be wondering, why am *I* talking to you about this? My Name is Minna, I am a master student in data science, pursuing a minor economics and exactly 3 years ago, I took this course! -->

## About me 
- I took this course 3 years ago!
- just finished my bachelor in economics at HSG 20 days ago 
- Doing an MSc in Data Science with a minor in Economics
- Working at RSEED at KOF-ETH

<!-- currently I work at KOF-ETH which is the Swiss Economic Institute at ETH, where we conduct research all kinds of economic research - about labor markets, monetary policy, and about the general outlook of the swiss economy. I work at the RSEED section, where we build software and teach people how to work with data to improve their research. 
As you can imagine, we use a lot of data and also work with people who use and process a lot of data. -->

<!-- In particular, we use time series data. I am 100% sure that each of you, have if not have used time series data, at least seen it -->

## Monitoring the Swiss Economy {.smaller}
::: {.panel-tabset}
<!-- this is what time series look like when plotted. Conceptually, you can imagine it as rectangular data, so tabular, with values at different points in time. -->

<!-- Here we are looking at a very specific time series, which is the global barometer: which is a KOF created system of indicators that enables a timely analysis of global economic development.  -->

<!-- to creating this barometer, aka measure global economic development researchers need to take a lot of other data into consideration, which is 1000s of other time series data -->

### Graph 
```{r}
library(kofdata)
baro_vint <- get_collection("globalbaro_vintages")
baro_20201 <- baro_vint$`globalbaro_leading_2020-01`
baro_20210 <- baro_vint$`globalbaro_leading_2020-10`

# visualize the 2020-01 version vs. 2020-10 version
plot_both <- ts.plot(
  baro_20210, baro_20201,
  col = c("cornflowerblue", "firebrick1"),
  gpars = list(
    xlab = "Year",
    ylab = "Value",
    main = "Global Barometer - 2020-01 vs. 2020-10"
  )
)
legend("topleft",
  bty = "n",
  lty = c(1, 2),
  col = c("cornflowerblue", "firebrick1"),
  legend = c("2020-10 Version", "2020-01 Version")
)
```

### Code 

<!-- if everything works out well, then this data is readily available, easy to import, cleaned and visualized in 20 lines of code like here: But since I am here to give you a more practical perspective of data handling, I can tell you that this is not the case -->

```r
library(kofdata)
baro_vint <- get_collection("globalbaro_vintages")
baro_20201 <- baro_vint$`globalbaro_leading_2020-01`
baro_20210 <- baro_vint$`globalbaro_leading_2020-10`

plot <- ts.plot(
  baro_20210, baro_20201,
  col = c("cornflowerblue", "firebrick1"),
  gpars = list(
    xlab = "Year",
    ylab = "Value",
    main = "Global Barometer Leading Index - 2020-01 vs. 2020-10"
  )
)
legend("topleft",
  bty = "n",
  lty = c(1, 2),
  col = c("cornflowerblue", "firebrick1"),
  legend = c("2020-10 Version", "2020-01 Version")
)
```

<!-- as a bit of background info, to work with csv data, researchers prefer working with csv data - as you've already learnt-->

## Ideal for Research: CSV
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bapau <- read_csv("data/ch.fso.bapau/ch.fso.bapau.csv") |> select(-c(adjustment, trans, variable, section))
head(bapau, 10)
```
